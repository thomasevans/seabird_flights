# Example figure for methods of flight analysis


# Load in data -------

# Points


# Summary data



# **** Figures -----


# 1. Flight map ------
# Base map with land on

# Points during flight:
# Colour - rainbow colour by time - with alpha channel (lighter for excluded??)
# Size - by altitude
# Mark example point representing aproximately a median point/ 
# representative location - maybe an X

# Circle showing distance buffer around island, with centre shown

# Lines between points
# colour by included - black, excluded - red according to truncation thing


# 2. Multi-panel figure of components over time -----

# For all vertical lines to indicate section of flight included
# No x-axis for A + B, but common range as for C, so can use common X-axis

# Panel A - Height (GPS + calibrated)
# - horizontal line to indicate median value during flight

# Panel B - Vg (GPS speed) over time
# - common time axis
# - horizontal line to indicate median value during flight

# Panel C -  distance from island over time
# - plot distance over time


# 3. Wind shear illustration ------
# Altitude vs. wind-speed - for example track

# Wind speed on x-axis (so that altitude is on y-axis)

# Height on y-axis, with range 0-100 m

# Indicate 10 m height, with dashed lines - for reference altitude

# Indicate actual flight altitude and calculated wind-speed for that point
# dashed lines - as for reference altitude


# 4. Velocity components ----
# similar to figure 2 in Tarroux et al.
# Could use common notation, for simplicity etc.

# Do for same example flight as all above.



# **** Output figure -----

# Could either combine all, using layout etc, or print 4 panels sepperatly then combine
# with another program, e.g. illustrator, GIMP etc.
# Best option is probably 4 sepperatly, then can combine to single pdf using
# Inkscape, following workflow described here
